# Natural Language Processing - Shakespeare-Text-Generator
Using NLP and LSTM model to train and generate new text in a Shakesparean style. 

In this project, I'm creating a dictonary of words based on the input text. The words are then changed into tokens. The model is fed with tokenized text and tries to predict the following words. It's then compared with the input data. When the model has reached a satisfactory results, I use it to generate a new text, given just a few first words.
